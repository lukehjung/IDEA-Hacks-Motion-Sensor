Motion Sensor for IDEA Hacks

Overview:
We were able to use bluetooth communication between a sensor circuit and a servo equipped circuit and to successfully have the latter circuit respond to specific hand gestures. In today’s demonstration we will demonstrate the connectivity by raising a flag model using hand swipes.

Purpose:
By being able to detect motion changes and to wireless communicate within roughly a ten meter range can prove handy and convenient within the home environment, e.g. using hand gestures downstairs to close some blinds in a certain room. The bluetooth range is ideal for a home setting and could provide an alternative to fully integrated IOT connected devices.

Main Parts List:
2x Arduino Nano
2 HC-05 Bluetooth Modules
1 Gesture Sensor, APDS-9960
1 Arduino-compatible Motor
6+ Assorted LED’s
